## About This Website

This website is all about my journey as a developer—from brainstorming ideas to actually building and launching projects. I might not update it often, but I’d love it if you could take a look and share your thoughts or feedback.  

### **Projects**  
The **Projects** section is one of the key parts of this site.  
Here, I share the projects I’m working on, and sometimes you can even test them out yourself!  
Take a look and explore what I’m building.  

I plan to keep adding more exciting projects in the future, so stay tuned!  

Check out the [Projects](https://arcoco-studio.github.io/portfolio/projects) page to see what I’ve done so far.  

### **Posts**
I’ll also share posts related to the projects I create. These could be my thoughts on the process about project.

Take a look at the [Posts](https://arcoco-studio.github.io/portfolio/post) page!
